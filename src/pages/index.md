  title: Distance Learning Is Here
  description: >-
    E Learning Hub is a resource for educators and administrators to improve
    their transition to distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic and
    beyond. 
description: >-
  We face an unprecedented educational challenge: according to UNESCO, roughly 9
  out of 10 schoolchildren worldwide are out of school. How can we provide
  excellent education to our students, inspire parent engagement, and meet
  administrative goals from a distance? E Learning Hub was founded to help the
  educational community achieve these goals.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
